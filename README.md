# AEM React integration module

This is a fork of the [AEM React Integration module](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/aem-react-js).
The main change is that it is now built to be consumed as Javascript instead of TypeScript plus the
React version has been updated to v15.

For further documentation on how it works please see the [AEM React Integration module documentation](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/aem-react-js)
